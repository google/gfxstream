# Gfxstream Future Project Ideas

Gfxstream is a first class open source project, and welcomes new contributors.
There are many interesting projects available, for new and experienced software
enthusiasts. Some ideas include:

1.  New OS support (Windows, Haiku, MacOS) support for gfxstream guest
2.  Rewriting the gfxstream protocol using python templates and working with
    other FOSS projects to de-duplicate
3.  Guided performance optimizations
4.  KVM or hypervisor integration to close gap between HW GPU virtualization
5.  Improving rutabaga integrations
6.  Improving display virtualization
